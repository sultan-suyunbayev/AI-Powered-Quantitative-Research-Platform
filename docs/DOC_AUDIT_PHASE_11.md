# Documentation Audit Report - Phase 11

> **Audit Date**: 2025-12-14
> **Auditor**: Phase 11 Implementation
> **Status**: Completed

## Overview

This audit was performed as part of Phase 11 of the CCEA Cloud Alignment Plan. The purpose is to identify outdated documentation and ensure consistency with the new CCEA architecture.

---

## Summary

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Files with TradingBot2 references | 17 | Noted (legacy name) |
| Files explicitly mentioning CCEA | 24+ | Good |
| Files needing CCEA context | 30+ | Acceptable |
| Language consistency issues | 3 | Acceptable |
| Archive directories | 15 | Acceptable |

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Product Naming

**Finding:** 17 files reference "TradingBot2" - this was the project's working name before CCEA architecture was formalized.

**Resolution:** These references are acceptable as historical context. The new CCEA documentation clearly establishes the current architecture. No action required as:
- New documentation uses "CCEA Platform" or "AI-Powered Quantitative Research Platform"
- Old references provide continuity for existing users
- GETTING_STARTED.md should be updated to reference CCEA

### 2. CCEA Coverage

**Finding:** 24 documents explicitly mention CCEA. Large integration plans (FOREX, FUTURES, OPTIONS) were written before CCEA formalization.

**Resolution:** Acceptable. These are implementation plans that don't need architectural context. The new docs/CCEA_OVERVIEW.md serves as the canonical reference.

### 3. Language Consistency

**Finding:** Some documents are in Russian (CCEA_CLOUD_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md) or mixed language.

**Resolution:** Acceptable. The plan has been successfully implemented regardless of documentation language. English documentation is complete.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Completed in Phase 11)

- [x] Create CCEA_OVERVIEW.md as canonical reference
- [x] Create Cloud zone documentation
- [x] Create Agent zone documentation
- [x] Create operational runbooks
- [x] Update legal documents for CCEA positioning
- [x] Create UI guardrails documentation

### Future (Out of Scope for Phase 11)

- [ ] Add CCEA header to legacy integration plans (optional)
- [ ] Translate Russian documentation (optional)
- [ ] Consolidate archive directories (low priority)
- [ ] Update GETTING_STARTED.md with CCEA intro (optional)

## Compliance Status

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| CCEA boundary documented | ✅ Complete | CCEA_OVERVIEW.md |
| Cloud zone separation | ✅ Complete | docs/cloud/ |
| Agent zone documentation | ✅ Complete | docs/agent/ |
| Protocol schema docs | ✅ Complete | docs/schemas/ |
| Operational runbooks | ✅ Complete | docs/runbooks/ |
| Legal positioning | ✅ Complete | ToS, Privacy, AUP |
| UI guardrails | ✅ Complete | docs/ui/ |

---

## Conclusion

Phase 11 documentation update is **COMPLETE**. The audit identified legacy documentation that predates CCEA, but this is acceptable as:

1. New canonical CCEA documentation has been created
2. Legal documents have been updated with CCEA positioning
3. Operational runbooks are in place
4. UI guardrails are documented

Legacy documentation can coexist with new CCEA documentation - they serve different purposes and audiences.
